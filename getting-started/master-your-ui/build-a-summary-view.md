# Build a Summary view

You may not need all your data on a day-to-day basis; however you want it well presented and easy to read! This is why we've created Summary views.

### Organizing your data layout with the Visual builder&#x20;

To configure a Summary view, go to the Summary tab **(1)**, then click "Add one" **(2)**.

{% hint style="info" %}
If a Summary view already exists, you can always reconfigure it by activating the [_Layout Editor_ mode](using-the-layout-editor-mode/).
{% endhint %}

The **Visual builder** works as a standard _drag and drop_ tool.&#x20;

It is divided into four categories: Formatting, fields, related data and actions. Add a “Section” from the formatting category and fill it with fields **(1)**.

If you wish to **delete** a Section or a Module from your Summary view, simply drag it from the upper right corner **(2)** to the trash icon **(3)**.

### Accessing related data

In the related data category, you will find all fields associated to your record **(1)**. For example in the demo, a customer has many orders, so you find ‘Orders’ in the related data section **(2)**. Adding a related data field works exactly the same way as other modules in the builder: just drag and drop it where you want **(2)**.

### Acting on your data

The Summary view is of course very useful to check at a glance all the information on a record. But, it is also possible to _act_ _on the data_ straight from this View. The last menu, **actions** **(1)** allows you to insert into a Section any of your [Smart Actions](../../collections/actions/create-and-manage-smart-actions.md).

For example in the Forest Live Demo, you can upload Legal Docs **(3)** for a company and Mark it as Live **(2)** from this Summary view.

The Summary view will most likely be the main check point for your operational teams, so customize it wisely!
