# Master your UI

### What is a view? <a href="#what-is-a-view" id="what-is-a-view"></a>

A view is simply the way to visualize your data in the Forest UI. By default, Forest Admin renders your data using a Table View when you access multiple records and a form view to access, edit and create a specific record.

### Forest Admin's different views

After browsing through the Table View of a Collection, you might want to dig further into a specific record. Click on a specific row to display a recordâ€™s page.

#### Table View

The Table View is the most basic view of your collection. It shows collections as rows and their fields as columns:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/2022-01-26_17.26.42.png>)

{% content-ref url="the-table-view.md" %}
[the-table-view.md](the-table-view.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You can switch your default Table View to a **Smart View**. Learn more [here](create-and-manage-smart-views.md#what-is-a-smart-view-business-plan).
{% endhint %}

#### Details View

The Details View is a list of all your collection's fields and their values:

This view is useful, but a bit abrupt. This is why we created the Summary View.

#### Summary View

The Summary View is much more user-friendly and it's created by you! Check out the [Build a Summary View](build-a-summary-view.md) page.
