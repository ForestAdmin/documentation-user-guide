# Customize your creation and edition forms

Your creation and edition forms can also adapt to fit your need.

### Customizing a creation form

To customize a collection's creation form, go to it **(1)**:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/2019-06-28_16.24.43.png>)

Then enable the Layout Editor mode **(2)**, click on the icon close to the record details header **(3)**. You can then show/hide certain fields **(4)** and reorder them **(5)**. Make sure you only hide optional fields, otherwise your database will reject the new record during creation.
