# Setup guide

You've successfully installed Forest Admin ðŸŽ‰ and you're wondering **what's next?** Here are a few recommendations:

### Get to know your new interface

Forest includes a _quick tour_ to take you through the basic views and settings: when you reach your project for the first time, you can click on the **blue circles** whenever you need more information!

We strongly recommend that you try our [Layout Editor mode](master-your-ui/using-the-layout-editor-mode/).

### Manage your collection settings

Check out how to access your collections' settings panel:

{% content-ref url="../collections/manage-your-collection-settings.md" %}
[manage-your-collection-settings.md](../collections/manage-your-collection-settings.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Create a segment

Learn how segments can help you better visualize your data:

{% content-ref url="../collections/segments.md" %}
[segments.md](../collections/segments.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Choose the right widgets

For each field, you can set how it is displayed and how it is edited:

{% content-ref url="../collections/customize-your-fields/" %}
[customize-your-fields](../collections/customize-your-fields/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Trigger a Smart action

Every business is unique: that's why we created Smart actions:&#x20;

{% content-ref url="../collections/actions/" %}
[actions](../collections/actions/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Add a new chart

Charts help you analyze your data. Learn all about charts here:

{% content-ref url="../dashboards/charts/" %}
[charts](../dashboards/charts/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Invite your teammates

Inviting new people to join is easy and Forest is much more useful as a team!&#x20;

To invite new users, you need to be on a paying plan. Go to your [Billing tab](../project-settings/other-project-settings/billing-tab.md) and **upgrade**.

You may then [invite new users](../project-settings/teams-and-users/add-and-manage-users.md).

To learn more about Teams, visit [this page](../project-settings/teams-and-users/).
