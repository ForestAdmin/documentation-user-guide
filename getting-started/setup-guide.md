# Setup guide

You've successfully installed Forest Admin ðŸŽ‰ and you're wondering **what's next?** Here are a few recommendations:

### Get to know your new interface

Forest includes a _quick tour_ to take you through the basic views and settings: when you reach your project for the first time, you can click on the **blue circles** whenever you need more information!

We strongly recommend that you try our [Layout Editor mode](master-your-ui/using-the-layout-editor-mode/).

### Manage your collection settings

Check out how to access your collections' settings panel:

{% content-ref url="../collections/manage-your-collection-settings.md" %}
[manage-your-collection-settings.md](../collections/manage-your-collection-settings.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Create a segment

Learn how segments can help you better visualize your data:

{% content-ref url="../collections/segments.md" %}
[segments.md](../collections/segments.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Choose the right widgets

For each field, you can set how it is displayed and how it is edited:

{% content-ref url="../collections/customize-your-fields/" %}
[customize-your-fields](../collections/customize-your-fields/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Trigger a Smart Action

Every business is unique: that's why we created Smart Actions:&#x20;

{% content-ref url="../collections/actions/" %}
[actions](../collections/actions/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Add a new chart

Charts help you analyze your data. Learn all about charts here:

{% content-ref url="../dashboards/charts/" %}
[charts](../dashboards/charts/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Invite your teammates

Forest Admin is much more powerful as a team! And inviting new people to join is easy.&#x20;

You just have to go into your project settings and enter the Users tab, then [invite new users](../project-settings/teams-and-users/add-and-manage-users.md).

To learn more about Teams, visit [this page](../project-settings/teams-and-users/).
