# Collaboration

Using an efficient back office tool is great, but using it collaboratively is even more powerful!&#x20;

This is why we've laid the foundations of what will grow to be an essential tool of your day-to-day work:

* [Notes](communicate-with-notes.md) - Leave a note and communicate around a specific record.
* [Approval workflow](../../project-settings/teams-and-users/manage-roles.md#approval-workflow-permissions) - Have specific users approve actions of other users
