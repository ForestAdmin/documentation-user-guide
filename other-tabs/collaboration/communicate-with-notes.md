As your team grows, so do all the little things it takes for your operations to run smoothly.&#x20;

With Forest Admin, you can assign your teammates to specific tasks, leave a note or simply comment a record, thereby simplifying collaboration and productivity all across your office.

&#x20;To do so, click on the "Collaboration" tab, then "Create a note" **(1)**:

Leaving a note helps you log your thoughts on a record and communicate or assign via the `@` mention feature **(2)**:

If you are mentioned in a note, you'll be notified via a **red dot** on your _Collaboration_ tab. The red dot will persist until you view the note.
