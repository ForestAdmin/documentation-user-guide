# Distribute tasks with Inboxes

{% hint style="info" %}
You must [contact a CS](https://www.forestadmin.com/contact-us?message=Subject: I want to enable the inbox feature) to have access to this feature.
{% endhint %}

The Inbox feature automatically assigns tasks among your team members based, improving the efficiency of your workflows.

## Creating an inbox

Once the feature is enabled for your project, navigate to the Collaboration tab and enable the Edit Layout mode.

In the left menu, find the "Inboxes" section and click "Create Inbox"

An inbox is always based on a segment of a collection. In this example, we will create an inbox based on the `Documents` collection and the `Waiting for Validation` segment, which contains all the documents that have not been verified yet.

You can then select between two dispatch rules:

- "Field based":
  - You can select up to 3 fields.
  - For each field, you can sort ascending or descending.
  - The records will be sorted by the first sorting field, in case of equality, the second sorting field is applied and so on to the third sorting field.
  - For example:
    - You can select the first sorting field to be the create date of the document, sorted descending
    - You can select the second sorting field to be the importance (not sure for this one) of the document, sorted ascending
    - For two `Documents` with the same creation date, the importance will take over for the first that will be assigned
- "Random":
  - The `Documents` will randomly be assigned

## Processing tickets

Once an inbox has been created, access it from the "Collaboration" tab.
