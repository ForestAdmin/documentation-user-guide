# Activity

{% hint style="info" %}
You must be on a [Forest Admin Pro plan](https://www.forestadmin.com/pricing) to have access to this feature.
{% endhint %}

The global _Activity_ tab gives you an overall view of all your team's activities:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (190).png>)

It allows users to track any actions triggered by a member of a Forest Admin project.

The actions that are displayed in the activity view are "write" actions:

- create
- update
- delete
- trigger an [Action](../collections/actions/create-and-manage-smart-actions.md#what-is-a-smart-action)
- leave a [note](collaboration/communicate-with-notes.md)

For each of these actions, the **user**, the targeted **record(s)** and **timestamp** are logged.

{% hint style="success" %}
Forest Admin tracks and stores these activities **without recordsâ€™ sensible data** except the ID/primary key to be able to reconcile data, on users request, in the user interface.
{% endhint %}

#### Export activity logs

As an admin user, you can access to a wider range of activities that occurred in Forest Admin; not only "write" actions (as detailed above) but also "read" action like searches, filters, record details visualization, dashboards visualization, records exports and more.

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature generally helps administrators for users monitoring and operational issues investigations.
{% endhint %}

Simply click on the "Export" button in the header, then select a date range and click "Export activities".
Shortly after, you will receive a link to download your export, by email.

#### Activity of a record

As your team grows, so does your customer pool. It gets harder to stay on top of everything that happens on a specific record.
Forest Admin also enables you to access the activity logs of a record by clicking on the _Activity_ tab of a record page:
