# Activity

{% hint style="info" %}
You must be on a [Forest Admin Pro plan](https://www.forestadmin.com/pricing) to have access to this feature.
{% endhint %}

The global _Activity_ tab gives you an overall view of all your team's activities:

It allows users to track any actions triggered by a member of your Forest Admin project. The logged actions are:

- Create
- Update
- Delete
- Trigger a [Smart Action](../collections/actions/create-and-manage-smart-actions.md#what-is-a-smart-action)
- Leave a [note](collaboration/communicate-with-notes.md)

For each of these actions, the **user**, the **record** and **datetime** are logged.

{% hint style="info" %}
As part of the _Enterprise plan_, a weekly report of READ actions is also available.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Forest Admin only stores those information **without records’ data** except the ID/primary key to reconcile data in the frontend.
{% endhint %}

#### Export activity logs

If you're an admin, you may export activity logs. Simply select a date range and click "Export activities". You will receive a link to your export by email shortly after.

#### Activity of a record

As your team grows, so does your customer pool. It gets harder to stay on top of everything which happens on a record. That is why we've implemented the _Activity_ tab on each record:
