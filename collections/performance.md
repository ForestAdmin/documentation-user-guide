### 1. Show only Smart Fields you absolutely need

**Smart Fields** are fields that require a computation: they can therefore lead to a decrease of performance while loading your page. [Hide](../getting-started/master-your-ui/using-the-layout-editor-mode/customizing-the-table-view.md#show-hide-fields) any field in your collection that is not required.

### 2. Reduce the number of records per page

### 4. Show only Relationship fields you absolutely need

Relationship fields are links to other collection records within your Table View:
