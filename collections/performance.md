# Performance

Loading performance is key to streamlining your operations. Here are a few steps we recommend to take to ensure your Forest is optimized.

### 1. Show only Smart fields you absolutely need

**Smart fields** are fields that require a computation: they can therefore lead to a decrease of performance while loading your page. [Hide](../getting-started/master-your-ui/using-the-layout-editor-mode/customizing-the-table-view.md#show-hide-fields) any field in your collection that is not required.

### 2. Reduce the number of records per page

{% hint style="info" %}
You can hide some fields in your table view; this will not prevent you from seeing them in the record details view.
{% endhint %}

### 4. Show only Relationship fields you absolutely need

Relationship fields are links to other collection records within your table view:

Having Relationship fields can decrease your performance, especially if your tables have a lot of records. Therefore you should display only those you actually need and use!
