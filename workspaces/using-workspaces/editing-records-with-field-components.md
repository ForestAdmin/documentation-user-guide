# Editing records with field components

You can utilize Field components within your workspace to modify the record currently selected. Here are the steps to do so:

1. Configure your Field components by associating them with a source, which can either be a Collection component or a Search component.
2. Integrate an Action component into your workspace.
3. Set the action to be triggered as 'Edit a _your collection name_'.
4. For the editing mode, ensure to select 'Related field components' from the available options.
