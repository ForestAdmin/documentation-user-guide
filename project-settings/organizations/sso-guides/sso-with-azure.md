3. Fill in all required parameters as shown in the table bellow.
4. Navigate to **SAML Signing Certificate** section, and copy the `App Federation Metadata Url` head to Forest Admin, select **XML file upload or XML file endpoint** and paste the `App Federation Metadata Url` to the Metadata XML endpoint.
5. You can perform some tests before enabling it for your whole company..
