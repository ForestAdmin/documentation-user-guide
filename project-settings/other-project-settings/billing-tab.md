# Billing tab

The Billing tab provides an overview of your Forest Admin plan and billing information. It includes two main sections: Current Plan and Past Invoices.

## Billing details

This section summarizes your current Forest Admin plan and includes details about your monthly fee, commitment, payment frequency, total number of users, and activated features. 

The estimated monthly fee is based on the current number of users. 

If your needs change, you can use the "Manage your plan" button to [upgrade to a higher plan](https://www.forestadmin.com/pricing).

## Invoices

This section displays a summary of your past invoices, including the month and year, invoice amount, and payment status.
