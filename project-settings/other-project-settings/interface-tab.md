{% endhint %}

In the Interface tab of your Project settings, you"ll be able to:

* Set your own project logo with `project avatar` **(1)**: it will appear on the top left hand corner
* Set your primary color **(2)**: this color will be used for some buttons and links

* Use your own custom domain: instead of accessing your app with `app.forestadmin.com/12345`, you'll access it with `forestadmin.my-company.com` or even `my-url.com`.
