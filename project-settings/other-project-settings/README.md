# Other project settings

Project settings are where you'll go to configure your Forest Admin project at a global scale.

For collection-specific settings, checkout [this page](../../collections/manage-your-collection-settings.md).

### How to access Project settings

Make sure you have the **Admin** role. If you do, you can access your Project settings from the top-right dropdown:

In this section, we'll cover:

* [General settings](general-tab.md)
* [Interface settings](interface-tab.md)
* [Billing settings](billing-tab.md)

For Teams and Users settings, check out this [section](../teams-and-users/).

### How to switch projects

You might have 2 or more projects where you use Forest Admin. In this case, click the _Switch project_ link in the top-left dropdown

You'll be redirected to the list of all your projects.
