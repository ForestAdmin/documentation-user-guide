{% hint style="info" %}
When creating a team, you can **optionally** copy another team's layout **(2)**.
{% endhint %}

### Manage your team's layout

The **layout** of a team is the way every visible aspect of your UI is set, from columns to smart views to widgets.

If you want to apply an _existing_ team's layout to another team, go to its settings page and use the "Copy" feature **(3)**.

{% hint style="danger" %}
This action cannot be undone! Always review your action before copying a layout.
{% endhint %}

To delete a team, you will be asked to retype the team's name as a confirmation mechanism.
