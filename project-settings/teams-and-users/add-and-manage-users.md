### Manage a user's teams <a href="#add-an-existing-user-to-a-team" id="add-an-existing-user-to-a-team"></a>

To manage a user's teams, go to his details page.

From there, you can:

* **(1)** Add him to a new team
* **(2)** Change a team he belongs to
* **(3)** Remove him from a team

Don't forget to save afterwards

A user must be assigned to a team at all times
{% endhint %}

### Remove a user <a href="#remove-a-user" id="remove-a-user"></a>

To remove a user, go to a user's details page **(1)** from the _Users_ tab:

You can then remove a user from the **Danger zone** by clicking on "Remove user" **(2)**. Confirm by typing "CONFIRM REMOVE" **(3)**.

### Add a profile picture

To add a profile picture next to your name at the top-right of your interface, you need to create a [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/) account.

Create an account and refresh your Forest Admin interface. Your picture should appear.

{% hint style="info" %}
For now, it's the only way to add a profile picture.
{% endhint %}

### Add user tags

User tags are useful for the [scopes](../../collections/scopes.md#using-user-tags) feature: they allow you to organize your users into groups and control the data they are able to see.

On the each user's details page, you can add a tag **(1)**, edit an existing tag **(2)** or remove a tag **(3)**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
A tag is composed of a `key` and a `value`. For a given user, the `key` must be **unique**.
{% endhint %}
