# Teams, Users & Permissions

As an [admin](manage-roles.md#permission-level), you can use [Roles](manage-roles.md), [Teams](create-and-manage-a-team.md) and [Scopes](../../collections/scopes.md) to control which users have access to specific resources. See [add and manage users](add-and-manage-users.md) to learn how to invite users to Forest Admin.

Forest Admin's user permissions can be summarised by the following features:

1. [**Teams**](create-and-manage-a-team.md)**:** You can have as many teams as necessary. Each user can belong to 1 or more team(s). Each user has 1 role which applies to all the teams he belongs to.
2. [**Team layout**](create-and-manage-a-team.md#manage-your-teams-layout)**:** The layout of a team is the way every visible aspect of your UI is set, from columns to Smart Views to widgets.
3. [**Roles**](manage-roles.md)**:** Roles allow you to manage all Smart Actions permissions, Collection permissions and access to Environments applied to a group of users. Each user has 1 role which applies to all the teams he belongs to.
4. [**Permission levels**](manage-roles.md#permission-level)**:**  The permission level of a user determines what Forest Admin administration permissions he has (e.g. Admin, Developer, Editor, User).
5. [**Scopes**](../../collections/scopes.md)**:** a scope is a pre-defined filter which applies to a collection and all its segments. It can be applied to specific teams.
