# Charts

KPIs are paramount to follow day by day. Your customers’ growth, Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), Paid VS Free accounts are some common examples.

### Where can you add charts?

Charts can be added in 2 places:

* In your **Dashboard** tab
* In the **Analytics** tab of every record of a collection

### What types of charts exist in Forest Admin?

Forest Admin can render six types of charts:

* Single value (Number of customers, MRR, …)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (351).png>)

* Repartition (Number of customers by countries, Paid VS Free, …)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (572).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
Only the 5 biggest categories will be displayed separately. All the others will go into a 6th "Other" category.
{% endhint %}

* Time-based (Number of signups per month, …)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (264).png>)

* Percentage (% of paying customers, …)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (543).png>)

* Objective (Orders passed per year VS objective, …)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (423).png>)

* Leaderboard (Companies who emitted the most transactions, …)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (555).png>)
